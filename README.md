I will try to make comparisons and graph of various aspect using pytohn and its librar. This was the nice course and easy to understand. Thank you so much for this course.

How to run the code
This is an executable Jupyter notebook. You can run and experiment with the code in a couple of ways: using free online resources (recommended) or on your own computer.

##Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)
The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the "Run" button at the top of this page, and select "Run on Binder". This will run the notebook on mybinder.org, a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select "Run on Colab" or "Run on Kaggle".

##Option 2: Running on your computer locally
Install Conda by following these instructions. Add Conda binaries to your system PATH, so you can use the conda command on your terminal.

Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:

conda create -n pandas -y python=3.8 
conda activate pandas
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade
Press the "Clone" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook.
Enter the newly created directory using cd directory-name and start the Jupyter notebook.
jupyter notebook
You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook file (it has a .ipynb extension) to open it.
